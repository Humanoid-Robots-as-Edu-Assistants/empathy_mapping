# Szenario "empathy mapping" for NAO Robot [v.1.0]
*Attention: this project is only available in German!*<br>

###About

An empathy map is a simple but very effective tool for compiling assessments <br>
of the perception and emotional world of your own target group.<br>
This scenario was developed for the bachelor's degree in business administration.<br>
Students fill out their own empathy map during the exercise. The exercise lasts ~35 minutes.

### How the program works

At the start of the exercise, Nao explains what an empathy map is and what the empathy mapping process is used for.<br>
Then he asks the students to fill in their own empathy map during the exercise. (These were distributed at the <br>
beginning of the lesson.) After that, Nao goes through the ten questions with the students.He gives the students <br>
enough time to fill their own empathy map. An acoustic signal shows when to continue.

### What do you need?

In addition to this program on your Nao, you also need empathy maps for the students which they have to fill out.<br>

### Plans of further development:

We currently have no plans to further develop the program.
